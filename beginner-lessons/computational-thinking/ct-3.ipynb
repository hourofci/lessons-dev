    "## Using numerals to visualize\n",
    "Yet another type of _visualization_ is to use **numerals** instead of colors to display the trees. This is probably not as helpful to the eye as colors or pictures, but it is getting closer to how the computer actually _simulates_ the forest \"behind the scenes.\" When **thinking computationally**, it can sometimes be useful to think about things in terms of numbers instead of trees, and _numerals_ are how we visualize those numbers. For example, the numeral 2 is used to represent the number known as \"two.\" We can use different numbers to _represent_ different types of trees, and we can _visualize_ those numbers using numerals. For example, below, 0 represents a healthy tree, 1 represents a burning tree, and 2 represents a burnt tree."

    "Abstracting trees to numbers is a simple but effective way of thinking about the concept. But there’s another abstraction as work here as well. In this simulation, we can see how unburnt trees react to burning trees in their proximity. They burn! But the trees on one side of the simulation don’t burn when a tree on the opposite side is burning.\n",
